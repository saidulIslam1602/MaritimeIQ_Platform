- **Configuration**: 4 partitions, 7-day retention, auto-inflate enabled
- **Data Types**: Vessel positions (AIS), environmental sensors, operational metrics
- **Throughput**: Up to 10 throughput units for scalable ingestion

**Data Sources**:
- AIS (Automatic Identification System) transponders
- Environmental monitoring sensors (CO₂, NOₓ, fuel consumption)
- Engine telemetry and operational systems
- Battery and hybrid propulsion systems
- Passenger and crew management systems

### 2. Stream Processing

**Azure Stream Analytics**
- **Real-time Queries**: Environmental compliance, fuel efficiency, route optimization
- **Windowing**: Tumbling windows (5min-1hour) for different metrics
- **Output Sinks**: Cosmos DB, Power BI, Event Hub for downstream processing

**Processing Jobs**:
```sql
-- Environmental Compliance Monitoring
SELECT
    vesselId,
    AVG(environmental.co2Level) as avgCO2,
    MAX(environmental.co2Level) as maxCO2,
    System.Timestamp() as windowEnd
FROM [maritime-telemetry]
WHERE environmental.co2Level > 1200
GROUP BY vesselId, TumblingWindow(minute, 5)

-- Fuel Efficiency Analytics  
SELECT
    vesselId,
    AVG(environmental.fuelConsumption / position.speed) as fuelEfficiencyRatio,
    AVG(position.speed) as avgSpeed,
    System.Timestamp() as windowEnd
FROM [maritime-telemetry]
WHERE position.speed > 0
GROUP BY vesselId, TumblingWindow(hour, 1)
```

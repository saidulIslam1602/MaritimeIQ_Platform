## üé® **Interview Demonstration Script**

### **1. Start with Fleet Management (30 seconds)**
"Here's our live fleet management dashboard showing all 4 Havila Kystruten vessels operating on the Bergen-Kirkenes route. You can see real-time passenger counts, on-time performance at 98.5%, and individual vessel status including speed and position data."

### **2. Show Route Optimization (45 seconds)**
"Our AI-powered route optimization system provides real-time recommendations. For example, you can see here it's suggesting a weather-optimized route through Lofoten that saves 2.5 hours, and it's automatically sent Northern Lights viewing alerts to 342 passengers based on clear sky predictions."

### **3. Environmental Compliance (45 seconds)**
"This environmental dashboard shows our real-time compliance monitoring. CO‚ÇÇ emissions are at 1,240 tons with 260 tons remaining in today's allowance. The system automatically switches to battery mode in protected fjords and maintains compliance with IMO 2020 regulations."

### **4. System Architecture (30 seconds)**
"The system health tab shows our Azure infrastructure - 24 services running across Container Apps, SQL Database, AI Cognitive Services, and Event Hubs. You can see CPU at 23.5%, memory at 67.8%, and we're processing 145 requests per second with 99.95% uptime."

**Total Demo Time: ~2.5 minutes**

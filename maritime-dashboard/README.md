## 🎨 **Interview Demonstration Script**

### **1. Start with Fleet Management (30 seconds)**
"Here's our live fleet management dashboard showing all 4 Havila Kystruten vessels operating on the Bergen-Kirkenes route. You can see real-time passenger counts, on-time performance at 98.5%, and individual vessel status including speed and position data."

### **2. Show Route Optimization (45 seconds)**
"Our AI-powered route optimization system provides real-time recommendations. For example, you can see here it's suggesting a weather-optimized route through Lofoten that saves 2.5 hours, and it's automatically sent Northern Lights viewing alerts to 342 passengers based on clear sky predictions."

### **3. Environmental Compliance (45 seconds)**
"This environmental dashboard shows our real-time compliance monitoring. CO₂ emissions are at 1,240 tons with 260 tons remaining in today's allowance. The system automatically switches to battery mode in protected fjords and maintains compliance with IMO 2020 regulations."

### **4. System Architecture (30 seconds)**
"The system health tab shows our Azure infrastructure - 24 services running across Container Apps, SQL Database, AI Cognitive Services, and Event Hubs. You can see CPU at 23.5%, memory at 67.8%, and we're processing 145 requests per second with 99.95% uptime."

**Total Demo Time: ~2.5 minutes**

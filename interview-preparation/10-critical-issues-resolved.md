    {
        var kafkaMessage = new Message<string, string>
        {
            Key = key,
            Value = message,
            Headers = new Headers { new Header("timestamp", Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(DateTime.UtcNow.ToString())) }
        };
        
        await _producer.ProduceAsync(topic, kafkaMessage);
    }
}

// Event Hub Processor with Circuit Breaker
public class MaritimeStreamingProcessor
{
    private readonly CircuitBreaker _circuitBreaker;
    
    public async Task ProcessEventsAsync(ProcessEventArgs eventArgs)
    {
        await _circuitBreaker.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
        {
            // Process maritime data with error handling
            await ProcessMaritimeData(eventArgs.Data);
        });
    }
}
```

### **Key Learning**

    .option("eventhubs.connectionString", connection_string) \
    .load()

# Data Quality Validation
validated_df = raw_df.filter(
    col("vessel_id").isNotNull() &
    col("latitude").between(-90, 90) &
    col("longitude").between(-180, 180) &
    col("timestamp").isNotNull()
)

# Silver Layer - Cleaned Data
cleaned_df = validated_df.withColumn("data_quality_score", 
    when(col("speed") > 0, 1.0).otherwise(0.8)
).withColumn("processing_timestamp", current_timestamp())

# Gold Layer - Aggregated Analytics
fleet_analytics = cleaned_df.groupBy("vessel_id", "date") \
    .agg(
        avg("speed").alias("avg_speed"),
        count("*").alias("position_updates"),
        max("fuel_consumption").alias("max_fuel_consumption")
    )

# Write to Delta Lake with ACID transactions
cleaned_df.writeStream \
    .format("delta") \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "/delta/checkpoints/maritime_silver") \
    .trigger(processingTime="30 seconds") \
    .start("/delta/maritime_silver")
```

1. **Investigation**: Identified the dual file structure (solution + project files)
2. **Architecture Analysis**: Understood that solution file manages multiple projects (Web API + Azure Functions)
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Discovered Functions project references main project
4. **Impact Assessment**: Realized all CI/CD and deployment scripts needed updating

### **Solution Implemented**
```bash
# ❌ Before (caused error)
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet publish

# ✅ After (explicit solution file)
dotnet restore ./Maritime_DataEngineering_Plaatform.sln
dotnet build ./Maritime_DataEngineering_Plaatform.sln --configuration Release
dotnet publish ./Maritime_DataEngineering_Plaatform.sln --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

### **Files Updated**
- `.github/workflows/deploy-kafka-integration.yml`
- `deployment/deploy-full-platform.sh`
- All CI/CD pipelines standardized

### **Key Learning**
- Always specify solution files in multi-project repositories
- CI/CD pipelines must be explicit about build targets
- Solution files provide better dependency management than individual project files

## 2. **Branding Consistency: Havila References Removal**

### **Problem**
GitHub repository description and codebase contained numerous "Havila" references from the original template, creating branding inconsistency for the MaritimeIQ Platform.

### **Root Cause Analysis**
- Project was built from a maritime template with Havila Kystruten branding
- References scattered across 100+ files in multiple formats (JSON, SQL, CSS, HTML, JS)
- Included configuration files, database schemas, deployment scripts, and UI components

### **Analytical Thinking Process**
1. **Scope Assessment**: Used `grep` to identify all Havila references across the codebase
2. **Categorization**: Grouped references by type (company names, vessel names, email domains, CSS classes)
3. **Systematic Replacement**: Created mapping strategy for consistent naming
4. **Verification**: Ensured no references remained in source files

### **Solution Implemented**
```bash
# Systematic replacement strategy
find . -name "*.json" -o -name "*.sql" -o -name "*.sh" | xargs sed -i 's/havila-maritime-analytics/maritimeiq-analytics/g'
find . -name "*.css" -o -name "*.html" -o -name "*.js" | xargs sed -i 's/havila-blue/maritime-blue/g'
# ... 20+ similar commands for different reference types
```

### **Mapping Strategy**
| Original | Replacement | Context |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| "Havila Kystruten" | "MaritimeIQ Platform" | Company names |
| "MS Havila *" | "MS Maritime *" | Vessel names |
| `havila-maritime-*` | `maritimeiq-platform-*` | Resource names |
| `@havila.no` | `@maritimeiq.com` | Email domains |
| `havila-blue` | `maritime-blue` | CSS classes |

### **Files Updated**
- 278 files modified across the entire codebase
- Database schemas, PowerBI configs, deployment scripts, dashboard files
- All build artifacts regenerated with new branding

### **Key Learning**
- Brand consistency requires systematic approach across all file types
- Automated search-and-replace tools essential for large-scale refactoring
- Verification process critical to ensure complete transformation

Need to validate that the build process works correctly after all changes, ensuring the solution builds, tests, and deploys properly.

### **Analytical Thinking Process**
1. **Pipeline Design**: Created comprehensive 5-stage validation process
2. **Dependency Management**: Ensured proper restore → build → test → publish flow
3. **Error Handling**: Identified and resolved warnings during build process
4. **Verification**: Tested executable functionality

### **Solution Implemented**
```bash
# Stage 1: Restore Dependencies
dotnet restore Maritime_DataEngineering_Plaatform.sln

# Stage 2: Build Debug
dotnet build Maritime_DataEngineering_Plaatform.sln --configuration Debug --no-restore

# Stage 3: Build Release
dotnet build Maritime_DataEngineering_Plaatform.sln --configuration Release --no-restore

# Stage 4: Run Tests
dotnet test Maritime_DataEngineering_Plaatform.sln --configuration Release --no-build --verbosity normal

# Stage 5: Publish for Deployment
dotnet publish Maritime_DataEngineering_Plaatform.sln --configuration Release --output ./publish --no-build
```

### **Results**
